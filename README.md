## Introducing Devin, the first AI software engineer

With our advances in long-term reasoning and planning, Devin can plan and execute complex engineering tasks requiring thousands of decisions. Devin can recall relevant context at every step, learn over time, and fix mistakes.
We've also equipped Devin with common developer tools including the shell, code editor, and browser within a sandboxed compute environmentâ€”everything a human would need to do their work.
Finally, we've given Devin the ability to actively collaborate with the user. Devin reports on its progress in real time, accepts feedback, and works together with you through design choices as needed.
